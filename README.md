# Amazon_Orders
View amazon purchase details such as: Total Spent, Total Purchases, Most Expensive Purchase

In the same directoy as the .py file, you will need to add the CSV for your amazon purchases.
You can get the .CSV file from: https://www.amazon.com/b2b/reports (goes back to 2006)
Name the file 'amazon_orders.csv' or update the .py code on line 4 to whatver you want to name the file.

I have not included a CSV, but I have included a screenshot of some results.
